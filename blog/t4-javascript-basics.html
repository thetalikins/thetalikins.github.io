      <h3>How does Javascript compare with HTML and CSS?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p>Where CSS and HTML are static, load-on-command web page features, Javascript is a resposive language that reacts and actively re/animates the page while it's open. It's adaptable in its command features; where HTML/CSS say "do this," JS says "If this, than do that. If not, do this instead."</p>

      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example "waking up" or "brushing your teeth.""
      </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> Control loops and flow refer to the order in which statements or functions are executed. In the suggestion, "waking up" would include the control flor of regain consciousness, open eyes, stretch in bed, (often) snooze alarm, sit upright, exit bed, proceed to bathroom, etc.  Loops would encourage me to check the status of my tasks on a given day, as what is most pressing on a Monday would likely be quite differnt than the loops required on a Saturday.</p>

     <h3> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
     </h3> 
            <br> 
                     <p>An array is a set of data from which to pull; they also start at the numerical index of 0. Objects get stored in "key value pairs" which essentially means the key has to be called directly to  access it's value.  </p>
            <br><br>

    <h3> Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
    </h3> 
         <br> 
                     <p>Functions allow the user to input what is essentially a command equation that can have an infinite set of varialbes switched in and out of it. They allow users to catagories and call certain types of data from a consistent format, keeping it organized and properly attributed.</p>
