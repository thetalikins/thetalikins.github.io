      <h3>What does life look like through the "pleasure, passion, purpose" lens? 
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> These threee types of happiness give scale and context to the types o fulfillment we seek in life. Where <b>pleasure</b> is fleeting and attributed to the kind of lifestyle lived by rockstars, it is often thought of as the kind of happiness that will bring one personal sustainability and fulfillment. Motivation rooted in <b>passion</b> has more of a medium grade sustainability, as it's less focused on immediate gratification. Further, the <b>purpose</b> lens gives a lifetime of context and, when worked towards, can movivate someone to achieve the biggest picture happiness with their work. </p>

        <h3>What matters most to me?
          </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> Perhaps obviously I've rewritten this question, but I was inspired to answer the "my ideal life" invitation in the chapter. Here it is!</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>My Ideal Future
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p>My ideal future is one comprised of meaningful creative relationships that function collaboratively, underwritten by a flexible and sustainable career that is companionate to my soul work in this life.
                    
                    <br>I identify my soul work as providing reflective, supportive, and affirming space particularly for young people on the margins of society, especially queer youth. I want to advance access to mindfulness tools, especially embodiment and the avenues of creative expression therefrom. 
                    
                    <br>In my ideal future, I’ll hold a second passport from a politically stable country (other than the US) and perhaps own a home there. I’ll work with likeminded peers advancing access to information through technology, preferably the kind that promotes well-being. Even at times when the work seems tedious, I’ll be able to zoom out and see the big-picture features and goals of my life. This foundation will enable me to:
                    
                    <br>a) travel, lecture, and teach as a mindfulness educator 
                    
                    <br>b) collaborate with peers both artistically and in veins of activism
                    
                    <br>c) create a lifestyle within capitalism that is sustainable, giving me the tools to let the more spiritual, artistic, and community-development goals in my life develop organically.
                    
                    <br>The most important lesson I’ve learned in the last 2 years boils down to this: listen. If you have the intention to serve, you must first ask and listen to what is needed. One of the keys to my longer term mental health is to be able to ask the right people the right questions, and be able to deliver the right result. 
                    
                    <br>I have a lot of learning to engage in before I understand my role and creative capabilities as a programmer. I really am unsure what direction this path will take me on, or how my career path will either divert, postpone, or compliment my soul work. 
                    
                    <br>What I do feel clear on is that right now, my mission is to grow into this part of my awareness and adopt the skillset of a proficient programmer. In this journey so far I have not infrequently caught myself in doubt, frustration, or overwhelm. I relate deeply to the practice of bringing mindfulness and regulation to this craft. I have been guided to coding as the  professional companion to my soul work in this life. I am committed to sticking with it! </p>
