            <h3>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?
            </h3> 
                <br> A responsive site is website designed to adapt to fit the specific screen capabilities it is drawn up on. For instance, the same site -- if responsive -- can have altered designs for desktops and smart phones, while based off the same code instructions.  <br><br>


            <h3> What is mobile first design, and why is it important?
            </h3> 
                <br> Mobile-first design is an instruction and industry standard for designing responsive sites. By starting with the smallest screen, like the ones on mobile smart phones, the progression to fill larger pages like tablets, netbooks, and desk tops can progress more smoothly and beautifully.  <br><br>


             <h3> What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?
            </h3> 
                <br> Frameworks are tools that offer a developer a template to work off of. These typically include code for responsiveness and a few other key features, including grid structure, typography, buttons, and more.  <br><br>


            <h3> What is a wireframe and why do we use it?
            </h3> 
                <br> A wireframe is the first "mock up" that a developer/designer team does to sketch out their basic plan for the website. Wireframes are a crucial first step in getting designer, developer, and client on the same page as the project is approached. <br><br>
