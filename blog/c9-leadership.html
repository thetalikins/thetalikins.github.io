      <h3> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?

        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p>Honestly, I have not had many experiences with authenticly compassionate leadership, specifically in the workplace. I'm glad to say I've encountered it in mindful classrooms, but the dualistic intentions in the workplace (bottom lines and emotional appeals) often feel very separate, isolating, and inevitably compromising of their mutual integrity. </p>

        <h3> Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it? 
        
        </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> This is a beautiful way to expand both the capacity of the heart and the mind's ability to conceive of its power in this way :) </p>

          <h3> Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?

        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> Tonglen is perhaps my favorite compassion exercise. I have had some pretty intimate practice with in over the last ~6 years. I know it can radically change lives! On mroe than one occasion, I practiced tonglen for the people who most hurt me in my life, and it dramatically improved the relationship. This time around, I practiced tonglen for myself and the buzzing anxiety I'm feeling as we get closer and closer to bootcamp. It was a restful experience and much needed!</p>

        <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p>The SCARF Model (Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness) iterates that there are LOTS of ways to experience a heightened sense of fear in relationship. I had a few moments of feeling a SCARF reaction during Phase 0, while asking what I expected were "dumb" questions early on. I even experienced a few moments of comparison while judging some of my work produced in Phase 0 against that of my cohort members. Coming into Bootcamp, I am certain that there will be endless opportunities to practice mindfulness with these kind of reactions or awarenesses.</p>

        <h3> Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p>My difficult conversation related to a friend who I suspected was angry with me for a perceived breach of trust. When I brought up the conversation, I hoped we could discuss the events and any feelings that might be lingering. I had observed them expressing anger towards me and then denying it, so I wanted to provide a space to be genuine and get the cards on the table. To my surprise, this person did not want to engage and simply said "no hard feelings." At this point I have no choice but to believe them and carry on under that pretense. </p>
