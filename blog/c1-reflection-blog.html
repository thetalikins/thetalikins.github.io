     <h2>Question 1: what's your take on the EDA experience? </h2>
        <br> What this video has clarified for me is that EDA is a rigorous approach to team-driven learning, teaching skills rather than (or perhaps alongside) tools.  <br><br>
     <h2>Question 2: What are your impressions? </h2>
        <br> Instinctually I sense that we will all be challenged in a multitude of ways during this process. I took special note of the "deny yourself security of numbers" that Sherif brought up related to graduation and employment rates. <br><br>
     <h2>Question 3: How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </h2>
        <br> I'm really excited to get more in the "kitchen rather than table" approach to learning. Heirarchical learning has brought me elements of stress, comparison, and egoism throughout the years, particularly as a teacher.  I am very enthusiastic to explore this new learning style, which requires both effort and humility from us all.<br><br>
     <h2>Question 4: Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <br> Changed isn't the word I'd use. I'd say they've deepened -- the intentions and values I've witnessned at play at EDA were expanded and deepened throughout Sherif's video. <br><br>
     <h2>Question 5: Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <br> To quote Ming (and Amy Poehler), "yes please!" Certainly I am excited for this new chapter, experience, and style... and you bet your bottom dollar I've got nerves! But working through them, observing my mind, and developing a more friendly relationship with this experience of discomfort is already proving a rewarding journey. <br><br> </p>
