        <h3>What learning did you take from the chapter?</h3> <br> As someone who has both studied mindfulness extensively and followed Mengs's work for over a year, actually sitting down to this chapter was totally delightful. I myself have struggled at times to find really business-savvy language to explain the benefits of mindfulness and in my other life as a meditation instructor, will be taking many cues from him! On a more personal note, everything that was shared really resonated with me. While exploring the chapter, I took a moment to reflect on my own "baseline of happiness" since I started practicing meditation 7 years ago. It is worlds different than it was, as Meng suggested! My baseline disposition is increasingly positive. What a gift!!!  <br><br>
        <h3> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3> <br> When I first started practicing mindfulness, I'll be honest, it felt like a chore. Not only was it difficult to muster the motivation or intentional time to practice, but the truth is I really did not like experiencing my own mind. It was cluttered, frightened, and anxious. I frequently found my mind wandering into worry, bad outcomes, and worst case scenarios. It wasn't fun! But the more I've spent time exploring mindfulness, the more I've come to befriend the fear, the hurt, and the pain that created those patterns of thinking.  The more I practice, the more I can have an objective experience ("the watcher") of my experience ("phenomena"). Meng describes this distance in both humorous and scientific approaches. I'm grateful that after some years of practice, I know this slow-build sense of soothing awareness to be deeply true in my personal experience. These two minutes have become like wading into a cool pool on a hot day. What an oasis that friendliness can be! <br><br>
