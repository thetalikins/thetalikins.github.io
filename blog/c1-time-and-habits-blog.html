    <p>Question 1: Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </p><p> This week I engaged with mindfulness and the Start Small techniques.</p>
    <p>Question 2: What did you find interesting?</p> <p> I remain interested in working with discomfort, frustration, and road blocks through mindful techniques. I also realize how much more I have to learn about proper time management!</p>
    <p>Question 3: What worked for you? </p> Both of the techniques I've tried so far have been affirming and helpful. <p> </p>
    <p>Question 4: Which will you experiment further with?</p> <p> I'm stoked to try the Pomodoro method later this week! </p>
