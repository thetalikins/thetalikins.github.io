    <h3>Question 1: Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3> 
      <br> This week I engaged with mindfulness and the Start Small techniques.<br><br>
    <h3>Question 2: What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <br> I remain interested in working with discomfort, frustration, and road blocks through mindful techniques. I also realize how much more I have to learn about proper time management!<br><br>
    <H3>Question 3: What worked for you? </H3>
      <br> Both of the techniques I've tried so far have been affirming and helpful.<br><br>
    <h3>Question 4: Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <br> O'm stoked to try the Pomodoro method later this week! <br><br>
 <p>kia ora!</p>
