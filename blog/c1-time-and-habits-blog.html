    <h3>Question 1: Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3> 
      <br> <p> This week I engaged with mindfulness and the Start Small techniques.</p>
      <br><br>
    <h3>Question 2: What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <br> <p>I remain interested in working with discomfort, frustration, and road blocks through mindful techniques. I also realize how much more I have to learn about proper time management!</p><br><br>
    <H3>Question 3: What worked for you? </H3>
      <br><p> Both of the techniques I've tried so far have been affirming and helpful.</p><br><br>
    <h3>Question 4: Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <br> <p> I'm stoked to try the Pomodoro method later this week!</p> <br><br>
