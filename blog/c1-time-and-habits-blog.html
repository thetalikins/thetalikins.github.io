    <p>Question 1: Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? <br> This week I engaged with mindfulness and the Start Small techniques.<br><br>
    Question 2: What did you find interesting?<br> I remain interested in working with discomfort, frustration, and road blocks through mindful techniques. I also realize how much more I have to learn about proper time management!<br><br>
    Question 3: What worked for you? <br> Both of the techniques I've tried so far have been affirming and helpful.<br><br>
    Question 4: Which will you experiment further with?<br> O'm stoked to try the Pomodoro method later this week! <br><br>
