      <h3> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p>My mindful conversation went well! I took the opportunity to impliment these skills while having an important conversation about health and habits with someone I care about. By looping back and also dipping into myself, I was able to make sure she felt heard while expressing her desire for change, while also being able to advocate my comfort levels around how our relationship holds those new choices. It was a very healthy, affirming experience for us both. :) </p>

        <h3>  Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
          </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> What the author  calls "looping," I know as "active listening." It's a practice I've kept front and center in my emotional toolbox for the last 8 years since the module on Quaker Practices during my time in Contemplative school. </p>

          <h3>  Any other musings?
            </h3> 
            <br> 
                     <p> SIY is an amazing resource, and I so appreciate getting the chance to reflect and share these learning styles within our modules and cohort! If anyone wnats to give a whirl to these conversation practices, I'd love to jump in with you.  </p>
