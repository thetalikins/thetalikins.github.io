        <title>Analogy for HTML, CSS, & DOM</title> <br> I tend to think of these three components in terms of a human body. HTML would be the bones, giving basic structure and cohesion to the form. CSS could be described as the organs, creating more functionality in the body. The DOM could be the lifeblood, or the way the system integrats and flows!

        <title>Defining the Boxify Design</title> <br> The boxify design is a way of looking at all media design as a series of boxes, with smaller ones nested into larger ones. Together these create complex organization in a very simple manner.
