      <h3>What was the problem?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> In the middle of Sprint 5, I struggled to grasp the language basics of writing in Javascript. I felt blocked around the syntax and grammer of the code. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?
          </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> I resourced myself in a variety of ways, including taking breaks, seeking online resources (and getting better at appealing to Lord Google), and asking questions of my colleages. It's becoming obvious that we work best together and can learn together along the way! That is a very encouraging part of learning for me.  </p>
          <br><br>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> At times it was tricky to start practicing the theoretical basics we've been learning about, but I have maintained a decent headspace believing that with more practice and exposure, the syntax will eventually sink in :) </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3> What did you learn?
          </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> I'm continually learning about the balance around when it's best to keep hunting for answers on my own, and when it's time to ask for help. I want to continually grow my ability to resource myself, but I also know I can get hung up on certain details. It's crucial to know when to use whatever hints I can get, and when to keep trying for myself. This is a learning curve in and of itself! </p>

          <h3> Reflect on your ability to use the following methods to problem-solve:
            </h3> 
            <br> 
              <p>
                <b>Psuedocode:</b> I am gaining some confidence with that, though it is limited. <br>
                <b>Trying something:</b> Confient to try, though it doesnt always yield the answer right away! <br>
                <b>Rubber Ducky Method:</b> Haven't tried it.<br>
                <b>Reading error messages:</b> Gaining confidence; I've been learning more about the error codes on the bottom of VSC and that's very helpful as well!<br>
                <b>Console.logging:</b> Hardly any practice, honestly.<br>
                <b>Googling:</b> Getting better! This is my #1. <br>
                <b>Asking peers for help:</b> A very effective strategy! I've gotten lots of help so far. <br>
                <b>Asking coahces for help:</b> Somewhat! My peers seem more accessible, more often, than coaches. <br>
                <b>Improving process with reflection:</b> This is a helpful tool, can't get enough of it! <br>
