      <h3>Explain "scope" in JS to a non-technical friend. 
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> Scope in JS refers to the area of the code in which a rule or statement is considered applicable. There are two kinds of scope; global and local. Global scope means that the rule is applicable throughout the entirety of the code, while local scope specifies where exactly a rule is applied (and where it isn't). </p>
