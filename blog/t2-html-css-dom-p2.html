                <h3>What is a grid-based design?
                </h3> 
                <br> 
                         <p>Grid based design is a design method that breaks up a page into a percentage of it, and allows for organized navigation of thought using text, images, and blank space to guide the reader. </p>

                <h3> What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3> 
                <br> 
                <p>Responsive pages are an absolute must for today's digital world. From desktop to tablets to iPhones, each screen size requires different adaptabilities from different components. Responsive sites are ones that can flex from 1000px to 30px and still look great doing it. </p>

                <h3> What is semantic structure?
                </h3> 
                <br> <P>Semantic structure is the way that tags are broken up in HTML, including Headers, images, and forms. </P>
                <br><br>
                <h3> Any other points of reflection?</h3> 
                <br> 
                <p>I'm making a conscious choice to not get overwhelmed by just how much detail there is in CSS. It feels impossible to comprehend it all right now, so for the moment I'm just enjoying the flavor! It is a very adaptive langugae and I'm excited to gain more literacy with practice :) </p>
