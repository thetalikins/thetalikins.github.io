      <h3>Describe the insights and techniques you've used to grow trust and sincerity. 
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> In reference to the topics brought up by this chapter, some of the ways I increase trust and grow sincerity include personal storytelling, speaking my intentions, and employing transparency and accessibility throughout my journey to accomplish those goals.  </p>

        <h3>Empathic listening: How did it go?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> I employed empathic listening to a friend who is struggling with internalised self-aggression. I was able to reflect to them that they were hurting, and deserving of the compassion they so easily extend to others. Utilising mirror neurons by deeply empathising with this person certainly involved an element of feeling the pain along with them. Hearing their story opened up my heart, and that's what empathy is all about.</p>

        <h3>Loving Kindness Meditation: How did it go?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> Lucky me, I did a whole semester's course on Loving Kindness in Uni! This practice is very dear to my heart. Bringing those into the practice who I associated with a lot of pain proved deeply transformative for me and the relationships!</p>

                 <p> <b> My perspective: I believe I am wholly in my rights to bring a date to my brother's wedding. The idea that "only people who are married or engaged" getting a +1 is biased and unreasonable. It is senseless to apply universal rules to a group event when I am so clearly a special case. It's just one more person. I find it outrageous and bordering on bigoted that I would be denied a date. Is this because I'm trans? Because I'm queer? Because the groom secretly hates me? It doesn't feel like such a secret anymore.</b> 
                <br><br>
                 <b> His perspective:</b> It is totally reasonable to need to set perameters around such a massively expensive event. We're only giving +1s to those who we're required to by the modern social contract; it isn't intended to be discriminatory. We want you there and hope you can make it work to attend.

        <h3>Any other musings?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> First off, it was hard for me to figure out which conflict to use for the political awareness exercise. The more I thought about each option, the hotter I felt my own emotions go. But with some time, I'm glad I took the time to write out the two reasonable perspectives that are behind this conflict. When I was able to sit through the emotional waves, I was more easily able to honor the perspective of the other party. Additionally, the study about the growth-mindset vs. fixed mindset was fascinating to me! As someone who makes a point to validate and affirm those around me nearly every chance I get, this was a very helpful que as to how to develop this skill of mine!</p>
