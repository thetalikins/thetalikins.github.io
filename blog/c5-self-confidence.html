      <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> These two practices are basically the same. Mindfulness is an umbrella term for many practices that build an awareness of self, choice, reactivity, and experience. </p>

        <h3> Describe one self-awareness practice from the chapter. What did it feel like?
          </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> I tried out the Body Scan, which is a technique I've experimented with before. It felt nourishing to settle into my lived experience and get out of my thinking mind for a while.  It's always interesting to notice where the tense spots are and get to approach them with curiosity rather than reactivity. </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions Are Not Me" section?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> As someone who has practiced mindfulness for now 8 years, I have had exposure to this concept and experience within my practice before. Being able to identify the feeling states (and mental chatter) as all an experience of mind that is separate from that which is fundamentally me... well, that's the path, isn't it? :) </p>
