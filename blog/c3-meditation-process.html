            <h2>"Process Over Product"</h2>
                <br>
                <p>By focusing so much more on the process of building the site from the foundation (mobile first, wireframes, etc), I've gotten to taste the developer's modus operandum! It's so easy to get stuck in the innumerable details a site can have, so to start at the very beginning is a great way to stay focused on tackling a big project through bite-sized pieces.</p>
            <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading the chapter?
            </h3> 
                <br> I have been blessed to have been exposed to an abundance about meditation instruction and practice before engaging with the chapter. It remains an important part of my daily practice over the 7 years I've been a meditation student.  <br><br>


            <h3> What new things have you laerned about meditation?
            </h3> 
                <br>Much of the instruction was familiar to me. Of all the instructions, the thing I found most resonant was the invitation to be "magestic like your favorite mountain." It immediately brought that sense of presence and integrity to my practice!  <br><br>


             <h3> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
            </h3> 
                <br> The ongoing invitation to engage in Shamatha practice is always very welcome. I also appreciated the invitation to pracice mindfulness of spaciousness, intention, and then reaction as Meng described in the "when you have to itch" scenario. The other instructions I've had have largely been abstinence based!  <br><br>


            <h3> Any other musings?
            </h3> 
                <br> Meng is hilarious and is offering so many new layers of accessibility to meditaiton in this chapter. I feel uplifted by the reengagement! <br><br>
