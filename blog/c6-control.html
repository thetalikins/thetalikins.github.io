      <h3> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
        </h3> 
        <br> 
                 <p> So far, I've noticed I get particularly triggered around two types of experience: the firist and perhaps most prevalent is when things aren't working as I expect them to. Sometimes I catch myself saying there's a <b>needle in a haystack</b> in term of finding the broken piece of code. I can work through these feelings  by cooling off, taking breaks, and asking for help. The second way I notice myself getting triggered in code so far is when I am truly stumped, and procure help, I tend to think of myself as a fraud. This week more than others, I've felt a growing fear about my future as a coder. There are lots of things I'm passioante about in this life, and while I'm sure there's more intriuge to discover as I get more literate, I'm aware of a sense of comparison to some of my cohort members, which often leads to stories of work scarcity, self-abandonment, and generalized fear about the future.

        <h3> How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
          </h3> 
          <br> 
                   <p> This is a wonderfully simple explanation of tools to calm the nervous system. I especially liked the imagery of the Siberian railroad, with its cooling nature (and the necessity to work together in such extreme environments!). I know for myself that regulating through the body is a crucial way that I deal with being triggered. It's a great way to remember these tools!</p>
